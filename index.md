## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1:
This lab was very basic but this was my favorite lab because this is wear it all started. This lab taught me how to use github and how to commit and push our work. This also taught me how to edit my codespace as well as creating new repositories. 

Lab 6 Part 2:
This is definitely on of my favirotes because it built on the previous labs and we were building a card game. We coded a game called blackjack, in this code we interprated the previous labs and used coding like arguments and strings as well as if statements as foundations to build the game. This lab was a little rough in the beginning but once we looked the previous labs to help us, it was smooth sailing.

Lab 10 Part 1
Not my most favorite lab but a foavorite nonetheless. This lab was pretty difficult in the beginning having to check if we had enough arguments and using CountryIndex() to try to find the location of a country. We had to use a multitude of string if statements and loops for this lab which was difficult but it was definitely a good lab that I learned a lot from.
